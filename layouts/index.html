<p class="block">
  Websites can programmatically define a <a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">blogroll using OPML</a>.
  These blogrolls help people who read your blog discover other websites you think are worth promoting.

  This project maps connections between websites, web feeds (RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds), and OPML blogrolls.
  The size and interconnectedness of the network can be tracked over time.
  Exploring the network can help you discover new websites recommended by bloggers you already follow.

<h2 class="subtitle is-4 pt-6">Create your own OPML blogroll</h2>

<p class="block">
Joining the network is as easy as publishing your own list of recommended feeds using OPML.
</p>

<p class="block">
If you're using WordPress, you can manage your feeds using <a href="https://josh.blog/2024/05/blogrolls">Link Manager</a>.
</p>

<p class="block">
Hosted blogging services like <a href="https://www.manton.org/2024/03/11/recommendations-and-blogrolls.html">micro.blog support OPML blogrolls</a>.
</p>

<p class="block">
If you'd like to roll your own, first decide where you'd like to host your recommendations.
You can use static file hosting provided by your web hosting software or a third party service like <a href="https://feedland.com/opml?screenname=robalexdev">FeedLand</a>.
Link to your recommendations either <a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">via your RSS feed (preferred) or website homepage</a>.
</p>

<p class="block">
This website crawls web feeds and OPML recommendations starting from several hard-coded seed URLs.
If your blog is discoverable from those seeds, then your feed and any website in your OPML blogroll will be added to the network.
If your site is not discoverable from a website in the network, you can <a href="https://github.com/ralexander-phi/rss-blogroll-network/issues/new/choose">request that your feed be added as a seed</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle is-4 pt-6">Visualize</h2>

<p class="block">
A visualization of the network is also available.
