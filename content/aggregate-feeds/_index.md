title: Aggregate Feeds
---

For compatibility with existing tools, several aggregate feeds are available.
You may import these into RSS feed readers, although they contain many feeds across a variety of topics, so you probably won't want to.

Feeds are available in two variants.
The first is a full feed, which contains all feeds that have been discovered in the Blogroll Network.
The second is feed excludes any feeds which have been served with a `X-Robots-Tag: noarchive`.
As such, the second feed is suitable for building a feed archive while respecting the `noarchive` tag.
