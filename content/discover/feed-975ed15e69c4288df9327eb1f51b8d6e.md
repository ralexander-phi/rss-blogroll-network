  last_post_title: Review of Reputable, Functional, and Secure Email Service
  last_post_description: I last reviewed email services in 2019. That review focused
    a lot of attention on privacy. At the time, I selected mailbox.org as my provider,
    and have been using them for these 5 years since.
