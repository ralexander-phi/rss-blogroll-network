  last_post_title: 'Comment on Photographic comparison: Is the Kobo Libra Colour display
    worse than the Kobo Libra 2? by Ben'
  last_post_description: Thank you. This is the review I needed. I'd like to upgrade
    from a Sony PRS-T1 (2011), which has been a champ. I suppose the screens in either
    the Libra 2 or Libra Color would be a dramatic upgrade
