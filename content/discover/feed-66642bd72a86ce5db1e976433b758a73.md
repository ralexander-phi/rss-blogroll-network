  last_post_title: Comment on Preconditions for Common OpenStack Client Library by
    Alejandro Cabrera
  last_post_description: |-
    I learned about this common library while working on the python-marconiclient project. I love the idea of having a single http client that can be composed into other clients. That's awesome!

    Thanks
