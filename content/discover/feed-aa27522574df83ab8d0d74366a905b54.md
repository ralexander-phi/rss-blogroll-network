  last_post_title: Using the Link Hint Package to Extend Eldoc Functionality
  last_post_description: "Over the last few months, Iâ€™ve been writing Go Lang \U0001F4D6\n
    code.  I use the eglot package for Language Server interaction.\nWhat I like about
    eglot is that it wires into built-in Emacs \U0001F4D6\n packages"
