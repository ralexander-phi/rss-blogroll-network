  last_post_title: The story of my first A MAZE (and why I wish we had an event dedicated
    to solo-devs)
  last_post_description: It was an incredible surprise when I got the news that BlueSuburbia
    was nominated for A MAZE. When I started the project it was a secret dream to
    have it in A MAZE so I could finally go as a nominee.
