  last_post_title: Faster Homomorphic Function Evaluation using Non-Integral Base
    Encoding.
  last_post_description: Homomorphic evaluation of arithmetic circuits is exactly
    what FHE and SHE schemes were created for. In practice, those circuits imply the
    use of real numbers which seems inconsistent with the fact
